                                <li> Visual ARIA can be used within classrooms by educators to physically show sighted students what ARIA does and how it works, and how the improper use of ARIA causes accessibility issues when misapplied.</li>
                                <li> Sighted students can use Visual ARIA to evaluate their own projects as they learn accessible coding practices, with real-time feedback to identify their mistakes and coach them when necessary.</li>
                                <li> Online learning programs can incorporate Visual ARIA to provide real-time feedback as students build test widgets to practice through experience and repetition.</li>
                                <li> Sighted Quality Analysis teams can use Visual ARIA to reliably evaluate ARIA usage and related interactivity for all public and private services and products, without having to first understand or have experience using Assistive Technologies in advance.</li>
                                <li> Teams of sighted engineers can incorporate Visual ARIA within the development process to see how ARIA is being used within their projects, and whether ARIA is being used correctly according to spec when interacted with.</li>
                                <li> Any sighted person who is interested in ARIA can use Visual ARIA to see where and how ARIA is used on any website to better understand how Assistive Technology users are impacted by its use or misuse.</li>

                            <p> The bookmarklet script includes a small amount of JavaScript, which
                                loads the <a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whatsock/aria-matrices/master/The%20ARIA%20Role%20Conformance%20Matrices/visual-aria/roles.js">Visual ARIA JavaScript setup file</a>.</p>
                            <p> This small JavaScript file then loads the <a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/accdc/aria-matrices/master/The%20ARIA%20Role%20Conformance%20Matrices/visual-aria/roles.css">roles.css</a> stylesheet, which comprises all of the Visual ARIA cascading logic functionality.</p>
                            <p> The JavaScript file then monitors the page for changes to ARIA roles and supporting attributes associated with HTML input and img elements, which is necessary since these elements don't support the use of the :before and :after CSS pseudo elements.</p>
                            <p> Since all of the processing power is handled using CSS, visual feedback by Visual ARIA is instantaneous, and should work correctly within any CSS3 compliant browser within any operating system on any desktop or mobile device.</p>
                            <p> Though the coaching advice within Visual ARIA is geared for desktop keyboard interactions, the ARIA spec compliance algorithms conveyed by Visual ARIA are applicable to both desktop and mobile platforms equally.</p>

                            <p> You will then see various colored borders where ARIA roles are detected, and tooltips to convey their purpose and supporting attributes.</p>
                            <p> These borders and tooltips follow several distinct color schemes to identify the differences between static and interactive widget roles.</p>

                            <p> Additionally, the presence of CSS content via the

                                of the naming calculation.

                            <p> The Name and Description exposed by Visual ARIA strictly
                                follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/" target="_blank">Alternative Text Calculation</a> for interactive elements, which may not exactly match what is represented by the Accessibility Tree within certain browsers, nor what is conveyed by Assistive Technologies.</p>
                            <p> The value in exposing this calculation however, is to identify current bugs within browsers that need to be reported to their venders when discovered using Object Inspector for example, as well as bugs with Assistive
                                Technologies that need to be reported to AT venders. This will lead
                                to better interoperability support in the future.</p>
                            <p> It is important to note that Visual ARIA will include content
                                added using CSS pseudo elements as part of the estimated naming
                                calculation, but not for the element that includes the specific role. Otherwise the calculation would overwrite the status tooltips rendered by Visual ARIA.</p>

                            <p>Visual ARIA is a cascading logic program written using CSS, which allows any sighted person to physically see the use of ARIA upon any public website, including all landmark and region roles, structural roles, live regions, pseudo interactive constructs, and all interactive widget roles mapped within ARIA 1.1.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, Visual ARIA provides real-time visual feedback as interactive widgets are focused to and updated, and will also convey when widget roles are not being interacted with properly due to incorrect focus management or improper role usage.</p>
                            <p>Visual ARIA is meant to address the global problem that ARIA is an invisible technology, making it extremely difficult for mainstream sighted developers to understand and implement properly with consistent reliability.</p>
                            <p>For example, when developers who implement ARIA receive no direct input to validate their efforts during the process of development, and who have little to no understanding of how Assistive Technologies work, they have no way to assess the value of what they are doing, nor is there any way for them to learn from their mistakes at the same time. This is the primary reason why the vast majority of mainstream sighted developers still cannot understand the proper use of ARIA; because there is nothing for them to see.</p>
                            <p>Visual ARIA solves this problem by providing direct visual feedback for sighted engineers during the agile development process. The source code for Visual ARIA is included within the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/accdc/aria-matrices">ARIA Role Conformance Matrices</a> GitHub project as core mapping algorithms, which can be downloaded for offline usage or behind corporate firewalls.</p>
                            <p>Please file relevant bugs on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/accdc/aria-matrices">The ARIA Role Conformance Matrices GitHub project page</a> if issues are discovered.</p>
